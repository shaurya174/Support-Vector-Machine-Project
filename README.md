# 📌 Support Vector Machines (SVM) Project - Jupyter Notebook

This Jupyter notebook explores **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for classification tasks, covering key aspects such as:

- 📊 **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical data.
- 🏋️ **Model Training**: Implementing SVM using `sklearn.svm.SVC` and fine-tuning hyperparameters.
- 🔍 **Performance Evaluation**: Utilizing confusion matrices, classification reports, and accuracy scores.
- 📈 **Visualization**: Plotting decision boundaries and key insights from the model.

This project is part of a **Machine Learning** series designed to enhance practical understanding of classification algorithms. 🚀
